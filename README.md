# 8puzzle

Task description
The task was to create an 8 puzzle that tries to reach a given goal state, comparing the solving time of two heuristics. Named heuristics are Manhattan and hamming. The implemented algorithm that is used to solve the 8 puzzle is the A* Algorithm. The algorithm runs through 100 randomly created puzzles that are solved, for better descriptiveness.
